we need to follow lowest, mid and higest value in a array to find out a specefic numbber. 
Everytime we will split up in two part of the remaining numnber and search the whole array this way.
Mid_value = (low+high)/2
if n > mid, low = mid+1
if n < mid, high = mid-1
while(1){
    mid = low+high/2;
    if(num == ara[mid]{
        break;
       }
